# Setup

## Wallet

If you don’t have one yet, you’re going to need an _Ethereum wallet_ to use Perpetual Pools. A wallet lets you do things on the Ethereum blockchain (and its networks) like send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies, as well as use the many applications powered by Ethereum. Think of a wallet as your universal log-in for web3 – the internet of assets. Download one here:

Metamask is the easiest wallet to use, but there are plenty to choose from. Once you’ve found the right wallet and are finished setting it up, you’re nearly ready to start using Perpetual Pools. All that’s left to do is get some cryptocurrency.

## Ether

Ether (ETH) is the fuel of Ethereum. Without it, you won’t be able do anything on the blockchain except look around. This is ether's symbol:

You might have seen it before. It's Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency. Metamask has built in ways to buy ether, so you can purchase some directly to your wallet with a single bank deposit. Otherwise, you can buy ether on an exchange like Binance or FTX and send it to your Ethereum address.

## Address

Your Ethereum account has a unique 42-character address. It’s a string of letters and numbers that you’ll use to tell applications where to request funds from and where to send funds to. Metamask displays your address beneath the account’s name:

Together, an address and a private key form an account. Often, private keys are given to you as a seed phrase (a list of 12 words). Though it’s safe to give other people and apps your _address_, never give anyone your _seed phrase_.

## Smart Contracts

Now you’ve got a wallet and some ether, you’ll be able to use Perpetual Pools. When you interact with Perpetual Pools, you are actually asking to update the blockchain according to some instructions.

These instructions are used to make leveraged tokens, and they are written down in _smart contracts_ that anyone can use. Smart contracts are uploaded to the blockchain but they can’t do anything by themselves. They need people to interact with them.

{% hint style="success" %}
Pools smart contracts have been audited! Go back to the [Docs portal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MbdsGfc3PEsikGQpmCo/s/bQ0NkgDTHoDTt0kxcfIw/) to find the reports.
{% endhint %}

By connecting your wallet to the app, you are telling Tracer’s smart contracts which address to request ether from. If you choose to use Perpetual Pools, you’ll have to pay block miners in ether to run through all the instructions contained in the smart contracts and record the result on the blockchain.

That's it for the basics. Next up we'll learn how to bridge.&#x20;
