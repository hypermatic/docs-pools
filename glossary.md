* **Agreement**: The periodic transfer of funds between a Pool's parties.&#x20;
* **Address**: A 42 character alphanumeric string that identifies an Ethereum account.&#x20;
* **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The rate of yearly earnings without compounding.
* **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**: The rate of yearly compounded earnings.
* **Burn**: To redeem a Pools token for the funds backing it (see _Settlement_).&#x20;
* **Burn Fee**: A fee charged to burn a Pools token _(_see _Burn)_. Not applied to V2 launch Pools.
* **Collateral**: _See "Settlement Asset"._
* **Commit**: Placing an order to enter, exit, or flip a position in a Pool.&#x20;
* **Counterpool**: the other side of the Perpetual Pool, e.g. the Short Pool is the counterpool of the Long Pool
* **Data Feed**: See _"Index Feed"_
* **Data Manipulations**: any change applied to the original oracle data before it is applied to a Perpetual Pool Market, e.g. application of a Simple Moving Average to the ETH/USD oracle feed is a Data Manipulation.
* **Deploy**: Generate a new Perpetual Pool contract instance. &#x20;
* **Deployer**: The EOA that deploys a Perpetual Pool (account _Address_).&#x20;
* **Effective Leverage**: The real multiple of the price change that a party takes as payment. It is a function of Skew and Leverage.
* **EOA**: Externally owned account.&#x20;
* **Front Running Interval**: Time between Rebalances.
* **Index Feed**: An oracle wrapper that outputs the Index Price to be used for Rebalancing. Tracer uses standardised proprietary index feeds to ensure uniformity of data.&#x20;
* **Index Price**: The current price, or value, of the tracked market, accounting for any Data Manipulations. This is the value used in calculations at Rebalance.&#x20;
* **Leverage:** A positive integer used by the leverage function to amplify the transfer amount relative to the price change, e.g. 3.
* **Leverage Function:** A sigmoidal function used to calculate the amount to transfer.
* **Leveraged Token**: _See "Pool Token"_.
* **Long**: Party that takes payment when the price change is positive.&#x20;
* **Long Balance**: Pool funds belonging to the long party. ****&#x20;
* **Long Pool**: The side of the Pool that holds the Collateral backing the Long Tokens.
* **Long Token:** A share of a Pool's Long Balance, represented by an ERC-20 token.&#x20;
* **Market**: An instance of a Perpetual Pool, e.g. 3-ETH/USD+USDC. A single market is represented by a Long Token and a Short Token.&#x20;
* **Mint**: To create a new Pool token by depositing Settlement Asset to a Market.&#x20;
* **Mint Fee**: A fee charged to mint a Pool token (see _Mint)._ Differs between Markets but not within Markets.
* **Management Fee**: A fee charged at each Rebalance. Denoted in annualised terms.
* **Oracle:** the EOA providing raw data. ****&#x20;
* **Period:** Time between **** value recalculations.&#x20;
* **Perpetual Pool**: The contract that holds funds and keeps account of long and short ownership. Mints Pool tokens when funds are added and burns Pool tokens when funds are redeemed.
* **Pool**: See _"Perpetual Pool"._
* **Pool Token**: A transferable ERC-20 token representing ownership of either long or short funds in a Market (_also known as a_ _leveraged token_).&#x20;
* **Pool Owner**: The Address who deployed the Market.
* **Price Feed**: S_ee "Index Feed"_
* **Queued Trade**: A Mint or Burn that is pending processing.
* **Rebalance**: The transfer of funds and execution of Commits.&#x20;
* **Secondary Market**: Any market (DEX, CEX, or OTC) where Long or Short Tokens can be bought & sold with the exception of the Primary Market.
* **Settlement**: When one side of a Pool makes a payment to its counterpool to settle the Period's Agreement.&#x20;
* **Settlement Asset**: The funds used to settle a Pool Agreement. The Settlement Assets are held in the Market's Perpetual Pool contract to back shares (Pool tokens). Settlement Asset can be any non-rebasing and non-deflationary ERC-20 token, e.g. DAI or wstETH.&#x20;
* **Short**: Party that takes payment when the price change is negative.&#x20;
* **Short Balance**: Pool funds belonging to the short party.
* **Short Pool**: The side of the Pool that holds the Collateral backing the Short Tokens.
* **Short Token**: A share of a Pool's Short Balance, represented by an ERC-20 token.&#x20;
* **Simple Moving Average**: $$\frac{\sum P_n}{n}$$, where $$P$$ is a periodic data point and $$n$$ is the number of periods. Useful for smoothing volatility and reducing Volatility Decay.
* **Skew**: The ratio of Pool funds belonging to long and short parties. Defined as `long_balance`_`/`_`short_balance`.
* **SMA**: See _"Simple Moving Average"._
* **Token**: A digital representation of ownership in ERC-20 form.
* **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Depending on the context, the total value of the funds in a Market, the long balance, the short balance, or the Tracer protocol.&#x20;
* **Tracer Indices**: Wrapper products that manipulate or standardise oracle data, e.g. Indices, SMA, and Weighted.
* **Transfer**: When funds are debited from a party and credited to their counterparty.&#x20;
* **Volatility Decay**: The loss incurred by a Short or Long Token holder due to frequent directional changes in the Index Price.
* **Wrapper**: A contract that PoolKeeper can interface with. Transforms raw data provided by oracles.&#x20;
