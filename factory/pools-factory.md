# Pools Factory

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note this page refers to an upcoming extension to Tracer Perpetual Pools and the features presented here may not yet be available!
{% endhint %}

Welcome to the Pools Factory guide. Here, we'll show you how to customise your own Perpetual Pool and deploy it on Arbitrum using Tracer's Factory app. If you are looking for additional ways to edit and deploy the contracts, our [Development Guide](../developer-resources/development-guide/) has you covered.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must use a standardised Tracer Index Feed as the input to a Perpetual Pool contract. You can use the Index Feed Factory to standardise existing data feeds.
