# 6. Staking Rewards

Some Pools offer staking rewards. That means you can get paid just by having, and staking Pools tokens.

To check whether your Pools token is eligible for rewards, head over to the "Staking" tab. There, you can search for your token by name, or filter through the list by _Leverage_ and _Side:_

If there's a strategy for your Pools token, you'll be able to click the stake button on the right of the screen to participate:

Staking puts your tokens in a contract that releases rewards over time, so you'll have to sign a transaction in your wallet to enter.&#x20;

Rewards are usually paid in protocol tokens. Our [Liquidity Mining](../advanced-topics/liquidity-mining.md) section has the complete list of token rewards and their release schedule; go check it out!

The longer you stake for, the more rewards you will accrue. You can claim them at any time by clicking the claim button. When you're ready to get your Pools tokens back, simply click the unstake button and they'll be returned to your wallet.&#x20;
