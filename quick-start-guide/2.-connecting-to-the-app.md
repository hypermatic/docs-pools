# 2. Connecting to the App

The simplest way to use Perpetuals Pools is via Tracer’s application. We’ll use examples taken from it throughout this quick-start, so launch the app now:

{% embed url="https://pools.tracer.finance" %}

First, you’ll need to connect a wallet. Click on the button in the top-right corner of the screen:

By connecting a wallet, you’re getting direct access to Tracer’s smart contracts. Remember to read the terms and conditions carefully before you connect.

Wait... what’s a wallet, and what’s a smart contract? Jump over to our [Setup](../tutorials/tutorials/setup.md) page; it’ll get you across these blockchain-basics in no time.
{% endhint %}

Once you’ve linked your account, this pop-up may appear:

We expect most users will get this notification – it appears when you're on the wrong network. Perpetual Pools operate on Arbitrum One, an Ethereum layer 2. Switch over to it by clicking on the top link.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't know what a Layer 2 is, or how to use Arbitrum? Head across to our [Arbitrum](../tutorials/tutorials/arbitrum-one.md) page; it'll have you on the network in minutes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Pools app will automatically enter the network details in your wallet. Make sure to have Metamask open, so you can approve the new network and change it over.

When you're done, you'll be able to see the current network and your available funds where the connect button used to be:

If the app looks like this, you’re good to go!

From here on, we’re going to assume you have funds and gas on Arbitrum. If not, you may need to go back to our Arbitrum tutorial.&#x20;
