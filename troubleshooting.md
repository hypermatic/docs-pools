**I minted a token but I cannot see it in my portfolio**

This is most likely an RPC issue. We recommend you try another RPC endpoint by changing your browser wallet's network settings. For more information, please refer to Offchain Labs' documentation [here](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/mainnet#getting-started).

If the issue is not resolved, please open your console log and see if there are error messages. You can reach out to us on Discord for more help.
