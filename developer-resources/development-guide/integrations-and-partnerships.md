# Integrations & Partnerships

Tracer wants to power developers by providing support & help throughout the process of integrating Perpetual Pools. In order to do this, Tracer provides support ranging from design advice and contracting market makers to development help and co-marketing.&#x20;

We classify Tracer integrations & partnerships into three distinct categories:

* **Integrations**: developers looking to build a custom solution on top of an existing Perpetual Pool Market
* **Partnerships**: developers looking to build custom solutions using newly deployed Perpetual Pool Markets
* **Tracer Connect**: developers looking to integrate Perpetual Pools or its components as part of their offering on a private blockchain or in a permissioned environment.
